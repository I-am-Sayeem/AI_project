🦾 Warehouse Robot Picker Simulation

A Python-based warehouse pathfinding simulator that visualizes how a robot navigates a grid to pick up items while avoiding obstacles.
Built with Tkinter, this tool helps visualize algorithms like Dijkstra’s, A*, BFS, and DFS for intelligent robot path planning.
